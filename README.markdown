ProjectTemplate Demo
--------------------

This is a simple demo of the R package ProjectTemplate http://projecttemplate.net/ which is aimed at standardising the structure and general development of data analysis projects in R. 

It has been recognised on the R blogosphere that it is "meant to handle very complex research projects" (http://bryer.org/2012/maker-an-r-package-for-managing-document-building-and-versioning) and is considered as being amongst the best approaches to the workflow for doing data analysis with R (http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2010/10/a-workflow-for-r.html).

I've prepared an overview presentation using the tutorial provided with the package, and also started applying the tool to a very complex project I am undertaking which aims to compare the two common methods for age standardisation (direct and indirect) as well as the alternative method of adjustment for age as a covariate using Poisson models (and collate some concise code for these jobs).
